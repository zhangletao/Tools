    This is the combination in mathematics.

    The combination in mathematics looks like this:
                m
              C
                n
    This is a combination method of extracting m elements
    from n elements (without considering the order).
    For example:
                2       2       2
              C    == A    /  A    == (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) == 20 / 2 == 10
                5       5       2
    - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                5       5       5
              C    == A    /  A    == (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) == 2520 / 120 == 21
                7       7       5

              C    == A    /  A    == (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) == 720 / 6 == 120
                10      10      3
    This class allows you to easily calculate the number of combination methods.
